#. * The #VnckApplication is a group of #VnckWindow that are all in the same
#. * application. It can be used to represent windows by applications, group
#. * windows by applications or to manipulate all windows of a particular
#. * application.
#. *
#. * A #VnckApplication is identified by the group leader of the #VnckWindow
#. * belonging to it, and new #VnckWindow are added to a #VnckApplication if and
#. * only if they have the group leader of the #VnckApplication.
#. *
#. * The #VnckApplication objects are always owned by libvnck and must not be
#. * referenced or unreferenced.
